### Proposed Modules and Responsibilities
1. Authentication System:  
   - Beginner-friendly class: A User class with attributes like username, password, and role (customer or admin).
   - Create basic methods for login and registration.

2. Room Management:  
   - Admin-focused functionalities:
     - A Room class with attributes for room type, availability, and fixed price.
     - Methods for updating availability.
   - Subclassing could handle different room types.

3. Booking System:  
   - A Booking class with attributes for the user, room type, and booking dates.
   - Methods to check availability using a calendar model.
   - Allow cancellation or rescheduling.

4. Calendar View:  
   - A simple table view showing room availability for selected dates.
   - Interactive selection for customers to pick dates and room type.

5. Graphical User Interface (GUI):  
   - Use Java Swing for simplicity.
   - Design separate panels:
     - Login/Registration Page.
     - Customer Dashboard (showing room availability and booking options).
     - Admin Dashboard (managing room availability).

6. Database Integration:  
   - A small Java database to store users, rooms, and bookings.
   - Use SQLlite or H2 for simplicity.

### Project Plan
- Week 1:  
  - Divide the team: authentication, GUI, room management, booking logic, and database.
  - Beginners focus on implementing User and Room classes.
  - Intermediate coders design the database and basic GUI.
  - Set up project skeleton and integrate initial components.

- Week 2:  
  - Complete advanced features (calendar view, cancellations).
  - Debug and test user flow from login to booking.
  - Finalize GUI and database integration.
